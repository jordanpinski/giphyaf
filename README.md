Developed for the Built to Explore - A Dream of the Future Hackathon

With giphyaf you can easily upload GIFs and share them with the world.

## Issues

HNS domain (giphyaf.hns) will be released Tuesday.

This app uses the Content Record DAC to pull information for all previous uploads. With that said, uploads are tied to the host domain so anything uploaded/created won't available through the app after the HNS domain is setup.

## Demo

## Planned Features

- More options/formats & a better UX when creating GIFs.
- Adding a feed of all GIFs created by every user.
- Adding search
